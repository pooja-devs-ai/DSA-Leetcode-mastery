# DSA LeetCode Mastery 🚀

This repository is a **topic-wise DSA mastery journey** focused on **building deep problem-solving skills** through LeetCode-style problems.

## 🎯 Purpose

To master every important Data Structures and Algorithms topic — not just by learning the concepts, but by solving **real-world, interview-level problems** from LeetCode and beyond.

This repo ensures that I:

- ✅ Don’t skip any problem pattern related to a topic
- ✅ Know every core and edge-case logic behind each concept
- ✅ Never face an interview question and say “I didn’t know this existed!”

## 🔥 What's Inside?

This repo is organized **topic by topic**:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- 1D and 2D Arrays
- Sorting Techniques
- Two Pointer
- Sliding Window
- Recursion and Backtracking
- ...and more as I progress

Each topic contains:

- ✅ Clean Python solutions
- ✅ Hints (if needed)
- ✅ Notes or observations in `README.md` files
- ✅ Gradual difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)

## 🧠 My Goal

To become fully confident in solving **DSA problems in interviews** and **during internships**, and build the habit of solving structured challenges.

## 📅 Started: July 2025

Stay tuned! More problems and logic coming in as I grow 💪
